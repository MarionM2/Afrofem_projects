    <h1>What is CSS</h1>
    <P>Like HTML is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either.
       <strong>CSS is a style sheet language.</strong> CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.
       For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:
      <br>
      <br>
      <img
      src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS7rgExJI10lsT_oZ2n12lDfIX5BhgWbjv9DQ&usqp=CAU"
      width="300"
      >
    
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h2>
      <p>Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works :
      <br>
      <br>
      <img
      src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png"
      width="300"
      >
      <br>
      <br>

      The whole structure is called a <strong>ruleset</strong>. (The term <em>ruleset</em> is often referred to as just <em>rule</em>.) Note the names of the individual parts: 
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Selector</strong>
      <br>
      This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, elements). To style a different element, change the selector.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Declaration</strong>
      <br>
      This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's
       <strong>properties</strong> you want to style.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Properties</strong>
      <br>
      These are ways in which you can style an HTML element.
       (In this example, color is a property of the  elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Property value</strong>
      
      <br>
      To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value.
       This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property.
      (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)
      <br>
      <br>
      Note the other important parts of the syntax:
      <br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
      <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
      <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
    </ul>
      <br>
      To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them separated by semicolons, like this:
      <br>
      p {<br>
        color: red;
        <br>
        width: 500px;
        <br>
        border: 1px solid black;<br>
      }
      <br>
      Selecting multiple elements
      <br>
      <br>
      You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them. Separate multiple selectors by commas. For example:
      <br>
      <br>
      p, li, h1 {<br>
        color: red;<br>
      }

    </p>
